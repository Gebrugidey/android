        <div>you can be a memeber of this appplication if you are willing to do</div>
        <p>mostly working with branch is ver exiting becouse it may not face any errors on the other hand working 
            with master is unacceptable since it is the origninal it must keep change after testing.
            having copy keeps you from unwnated tasks.
